"The Matrix is everywhere. It is all around us. Even now, in this very room. You can see it when you look out your window or when you turn on your television. You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth. That you are a slave, Neo. Like everyone else you were born into bondage. Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch. A prison for your mind." - [source](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Matrix)

"It is so important and under-appreciated that when you wake up each morning, you should be able to create your day however you like.  Waking up to an alarm clock five days a week to work for somebody else is absolutely the most soul-constricting way to sell your life short.  If schools teach us anything it should be how to develop our personal passions into sustainable careers.  In a free, loving world schools would teach students to be self-reliant independent entrepreneurs, but as George Carlin said, "[the owners of this country don't want that, they want obedient workers.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acLW1vFO-2Q&feature=player_embedded)"

And so we're forced into public indoctrination centers from Kindergarten to Post-Doctorate all for a shiny piece of paper to give to our masters certifying that we'll be a good wage-slave.  Of course, masters don't need diplomas because they don't go begging someone else for a paycheck.  Masters create their own businesses, manufacture their own product, deliver their own service, and the success or failure of their job depends wholly upon them.  Wage-slaves, on the other hand, instead of taking responsibility for creating their own wealth, find an already well-established master and hope to impress master with their certificates, résumés, bells and whistles.  The problem with this is that you will always be selling your time wholesale to someone who is profiting from you retail.  No boss ever pays their employee the amount of money which that employee brings to the company, as that would cause the business to bankrupt.  The only way to run a successful business is to pay employees less than they're worth, usually far less.  So if you're working hard pursuing someone else's passion, slaving Monday-Friday 9-5 for someone who's buying your time wholesale, really think about what your passion is, save up some of that slave-money, then make a break and follow the entrepreneurial underground railroad to financial freedom and responsibility.

So now even though we could wake up at noon and spend all day relaxing if we wanted, that is no way to manifest a sustainable self-reliable lifestyle.  We only have a precious little amount of slave-money saved up to support us during this interim, so we have been diligently working non-stop at cultivating our conscious creations." - [source](http://www.atlanteanconspiracy.com/2012/09/wage-slaves-escape-matrix-masters.html)

cultivating our conscious creations to make a sustainable self-reliable lifestyle is the purpose of the hive.
